    <h2>Rules of Volleyball</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Volleyball is played between two teams, each consisting of six players.</li>
        <li>The objective of volleyball is for a team to score points by successfully grounding the ball on the opposing team's side of the court.</li>
        <li>Each team has three consecutive contacts, usually a bump, set, and spike, to hit the ball over the net.</li>
        <li>The rally continues until the ball touches the ground, goes out of bounds, or a team commits a fault.</li>
    </ol>
        <p><em>Official rules can be found on the USA Volleyball website <a href="https://usavolleyball.org/play/rules-of-volleyball/">here.</a></em></p>
